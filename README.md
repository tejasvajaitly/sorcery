# Collaborative Real-Time Text Editor 📝  

A minimal, real-time collaborative, and offline-ready text editor built using **Y.js, Next.js, Express.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN**. This editor enables multiple users to edit a document simultaneously while maintaining synchronization, even when offline.  

## 🚀 Features  

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Uses [Y.js](https://github.com/yjs/yjs), a CRDT-based framework, to handle real-time editing without conflicts.  
- **Offline Support**: Automatically syncs changes when back online.  
- **Minimal Design**: Clean, distraction-free interface.  
- **Next.js Frontend**: Deployed on **Vercel**.  
- **Express.js Backend**: Runs on an **AWS EC2** instance with WebSockets for real-time communication.  
- **TypeScript, ShadCN, and TailwindCSS**: Modern, efficient, and developer-friendly stack.  

## 🏗 Why I Built This  

In my previous roles, I worked on text editors that sparked my interest in collaborative editing. This project is a step further, focusing on real-time collaboration and offline functionality first.  

## 🔜 Upcoming Features  

- **Full Text Editing Features**: Font styling, bold, highlights, text alignment, etc.  
- **Mentions & AI Support**: @mentions and AI-assisted writing.  
- **Advanced Collaboration Tools**: Document authentication, private document creation, and role-based authorization.  
- **AI Hallucination Detection**: Detect when AI-generated text contains possible inaccuracies.
